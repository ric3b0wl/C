# Description 
## Brief
A personal taste of [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) hardcase, remix of [J03](https://www.printables.com/social/275753-j03/about)'s hardcase design from Printables.

## Let me example myself
I lilke the v2 model, but it was using flex hinge which in many case it was very pickly on the type of matieral used for the case.

Since J03 didn't post a clean model of BREP or STEP files, I had to take in a action to modifed his v1 model.

> the model were convert from STL mesh to BREP, some of dimenstions and geometry are not 100% accurate to the Flipper Zero.

# R(M)&D (measure and develop)
## What's new compare to V1 model from J03
- - removed one side of "tatical fingers gripper patern".
- + offset the latch to the top, since the orginal had on the side causing the other side crack open.
- + added GPIO opening
- + added USB port
- + added hole for wrist strap

## WIP
- [ ] GPIO cutout compatible with Wi-Fi Module v1 and [case](https://www.printables.com/model/179910-case-for-flipper-zero-wi-fi-module-v1).
- [ ] testing case's interferacing with the IR sensor, potentially adding cutout if needed.
- [ ] testing frequency of access of SD card, adding cutout if needed.

## Future?
> I would like to make my own measurement for the Flipper Zero, but for now it is good enough.
